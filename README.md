Pico W Web Server with LCD Display

This project demonstrates how to use a Raspberry Pi Pico W as a web server to control and display messages on an I2C LCD. By accessing the web interface, users can input text, which is then displayed on the LCD connected to the Pico W. The project also uses a background subtraction method to ensure continuous WiFi connection monitoring.

Features

Web Server: Hosts a web interface that allows users to input custom text.
LCD Display: Displays user-inputted text on a 16x2 LCD using I2C communication.
Counter: Includes a counter that updates on the second row of the LCD.
WiFi Connectivity: Connects to a WiFi network for remote control.
Socket Communication: Manages HTTP requests using a socket connection.
